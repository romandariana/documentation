Linux Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux is organized into two main spaces:

*User space* - the area of memory that non-kernel applications run in, executed
by a user in the operating system, rather than being part of the operating
system itself. It contains C libraries and user applications. User space
processes run in the user space part of the memory. The user mode is the
non-privileged execution mode that the instructions are executed with.

*Kernel space* - the area of system memory reserved for the kernel. It is
distro agnostic (various distros are built on the same kernel). The kernel is
loaded when the OS is loaded and remains in memory until the OS is shut down.
It contains the System Call Interface, the Linux Kernel, and the device
drivers. Linux drivers need to be included in the kernel so the hardware
becomes accessible in user space.

Linux Distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the kernel space remains consistent across Linux systems, the user space
varies significantly between distributions. Linux distributions are built on
top of the Linux kernel, providing different user space environments with
varying package managers, init systems, and default applications.

Common distribution families include:

- **Debian based**: Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, Kuiper
- **Arch based**: Manjaro
- **RPM based**: Fedora, CentOS

Regardless of the distribution, they all share the same hierarchical filesystem
structure. The root filesystem is at the top of the file tree (also known as
'/'). It has a number of directories containing files critical for booting the
system and system operations, including: ``/etc``, ``/bin``, ``/usr``,
``/tmp``, ``/dev``.

----

The following sections describe how hardware is made accessible to the Linux
kernel. The device tree provides a hardware description, while device drivers
implement the software interface to interact with that hardware.

Device Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~

The device tree describes the hardware configuration that the kernel needs to
understand.

Unlike PCI or USB devices that can self-identify, embedded peripherals such as
GPIOs, I2C sensors, and SPI devices cannot be automatically discovered by the
operating system. The Devicetree (DT) provides this explicit hardware
description.

Structurally, the DT is a hierarchical tree with the root node (``/``) at the
top. Each node represents a device or logical grouping and contains:

- **Properties**: Key-value pairs describing the node (e.g., ``compatible``,
  ``reg``, ``interrupts``)
- **Child nodes**: Representing sub-devices or components

Linux uses device tree data for platform identification, runtime configuration,
and device population. The kernel matches nodes to drivers using the
``compatible`` property—this is how the system knows which driver to load for
each piece of hardware.

Linux Device Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Linux device driver is code that knows how to handle a particular device. It
provides the right interfaces for the user-space to access that device and
abstracts various hardware details from the user-space applications.

Key characteristics:

- Implemented in C, in a ``.c`` and ``.h`` pair
- Stored under ``/drivers/"type"/`` in the kernel source tree
- Compiled with the kernel

----

With hardware described and drivers loaded, user space applications can
interact with hardware through well-defined interfaces. The following sections
cover GPIO for direct pin control and IIO for sensor and converter devices.

GPIO Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GPIO stands for **General-Purpose Input/Output** and refers to a set of pins on
a device (IC). These pins can send or receive electrical signals, but they
aren't designed for any specific purpose. This is why they're called
"general-purpose" IO.

GPIO is one of the most commonly used peripherals in an embedded Linux system.
The GPIO access is done using the GPIOLIB framework. Sysfs is a pseudo
filesystem provided by the Linux kernel that makes information about various
kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and device drivers available in user space
through virtual files. GPIO devices appear as part of sysfs.

The basic steps to use a GPIO pin from the sysfs interface:

1. Export the pin
2. Set the pin direction (input or output)
3. If an output pin, set the level to low or high
4. If an input pin, read the pin's level (low or high)
5. When done, unexport the pin

IIO Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Linux kernel Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem is intended to provide support
for devices that, in some sense, are analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog
converters.

Devices that fall into this category are:

- ADCs
- DACs
- Accelerometers, gyros, IMUs
- Capacitance-to-Digital converters (CDCs)
- Pressure, temperature, and light sensors
- RF Transceivers (like the AD9361 / AD9364 / AD9371 / ADRV9009)

The IIO framework can be used on ADCs ranging from a 1 MSPS SoC ADC to >5 GSPS
ADCs. It has been in the upstream Linux kernel for more than 10 years.

The IIO subsystem provides a cross-platform libiio library with bindings for
many programming languages including C, Python, and C++.

ADXL355 Part
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADXL355 is a Low Noise, Low Drift, Low Power, 3-Axis MEMS Accelerometer.

Features:

- Digital SPI and I2C interfaces supported
- 20-bit ADC
- Data interpolation routine for synchronous sampling
- Programmable high- and low-pass digital filters
- 0 g offset vs. temperature (all axes): 0.15 mg/°C maximum
- V\ :sub:`SUPPLY` with internal regulators: 2.25 V to 3.6 V

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Common Linux commands:**

- ``cd``: used to change the current working directory in Linux
- ``ls``: lists files and directories within the file system

- ``echo``: prints out its arguments as standard output; use ``>`` or ``>>``
  with the echo command to print the output to a file instead of displaying it
  in the terminal
- ``mv``: moves a file from one location to another, rename a file with or
  without moving it

   :width: 400

CoraZ7S Environment Exploration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. On your Raspberry Pi 5, search for *Terminal* and open it.

2. Write the following command to discover the available IIO devices:

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_info -s

Look for the IP address corresponding to *workshop-cora* machine. You will need
it for the next steps. To find it easier you can search by the hostname of the
carrier:

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_info -s | grep workshop-cora

The output should look like this:

.. code-block:: text

   0: 169.254.35.68 (xadc) [ip:workshop-cora.local]

3. Write the following command to connect via SSH to the CoraZ7S (replace the
   IP address in the command with the address of your board):

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh -X root@169.254.35.68

The password is ``analog``.

At this point you should see this in your terminal:

.. code-block:: text

   analog@workshops:~$ ssh root@169.254.35.68
   root@169.254.35.68's password:
   Linux analog 6.1.70-35308-ge2e62cc28c80 #1525 SMP Fri Aug 15 07:04:44 EEST 2025
   armhf

   The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
   the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
   individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

   Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent

   Last login: Fri Oct 24 19:11:04 2025 from 169.254.35.68
   root@workshop-cora:~#

You are now connected to the CoraZ7S. Every command you run from this point
forward will be executed on the CoraZ7S, not your workstation.

Example 1: Turn on a LED and make it blink with a heartbeat rhythm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Move to the LEDs directory using the command below:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /sys/class/leds

Here you can see 6 directories corresponding to the 3 colors of each RGB LED on
the board:

.. code-block:: bash

   ls

Each one of them contains the following attributes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``brightness``
     - Stores the status of the LED (possible values: 0, 1)
   * - ``trigger``
     - Changes the status of the LED
   * - ``max_brightness``
     - Indicates the max brightness value that can be written to brightness
   * - ``device``
     - A symbolic link pointing to the parent device of the LED

They may contain other folders and files, depending on the settings.

The important features of the ``trigger`` function are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Trigger
     - Description
   * - ``none``
     - The default state where no specific trigger is set for the LED
   * - ``timer``
     - This trigger causes the LED to blink at a specified rate set in
       ``delay_on`` and ``delay_off`` attributes
   * - ``oneshot``
     - Turns the LED on for a short period and then turns it off; the period
       is set in ``oneshot``
   * - ``heartbeat``
     - Causes the LED to blink in a pattern that mimics a heartbeat
   * - ``cpu``
     - Links the LED activity to CPU activity

The ``delay_on`` and ``delay_off`` attributes are active when the timer
features are enabled, and they will appear in the LED folder.

2. Turn on the RED color of the first LED by setting the corresponding
   ``brightness`` to 1:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo 1 >> led0_red/brightness

3. Make the red color of the first LED blink in heartbeat mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo heartbeat >> led0_red/trigger

**Challenge**

Make the first LED light continuously purple and the second LED light green for
1000 ms OFF and for 500 ms ON.

**Hint**

For the first LED combine two colors to get purple and for the second LED use
the *timer* trigger and set ``delay_on`` and ``delay_off``.

**Challenge Solution**

For led0 (purple = red + blue):

.. code-block:: bash

   echo none >> led0_red/trigger
   echo 1 >> led0_red/brightness
   echo 1 >> led0_blue/brightness

For led1 (green, blinking):

.. code-block:: bash

   echo 1 >> led1_green/brightness
   echo timer >> led1_green/trigger
   echo 1000 >> led1_green/delay_off
   echo 500 >> led1_green/delay_on

Example 2: Run a script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to execute a series of commands within a
script, rather than running each command individually in the terminal. You will
also learn how any Linux script can be turned into a bash command.

1. Run the script:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash /leds.sh

2. Now make the script available to be run from anywhere in the file system and
   run it again:

.. code-block:: bash

   chmod +x /leds.sh
   mv /leds.sh /usr/local/bin
   leds.sh

Example 3: Build a kernel object for ADXL355 driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to create a kernel object for an existing
driver and load it in such a way that the system recognizes it as part of the
kernel.

By running the command ``iio_info`` in the terminal you will see in the output
that there is no *adxl355* device found.

**Steps**

1. Move to the *adxl355* folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /adxl355

2. Create a Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

   touch Makefile

3. Open the Makefile with a file editor of your choice (nano, Vim):

.. code-block:: bash

   nano Makefile

4. Write to the Makefile the following lines and then save and exit the file
   with CTRL+S, then CTRL+X (pay attention to the indentation):

.. code-block:: makefile

   obj-m := adxl355_spi.o

   all:
   	make -C /usr/src/linux-headers-6.1.0/ M=$(shell pwd) modules

   clean:
   	make -C /usr/src/linux-headers-6.1.0/ M=$(shell pwd) modules

.. note::

   The indentation before ``make`` commands must be a tab character, not
   spaces.

5. Run *make* to build the kernel object:

.. code-block:: bash

   make

6. Load the new kernel object:

.. code-block:: bash

   insmod adxl355_spi.ko

7. Check again with ``iio_info`` to see readings from the accelerometer.

Example 4: Compute the temperature value from sysfs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The task is allowing you to read the content of attribute files and compute the
temperature given by the on-board temperature sensor.

The temperature is computed using the following formula:

.. math::

   TEMPERATURE = (RAW + OFFSET) \cdot SCALE

**Steps**

1. Move to the iio:device folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1

2. Here you can see all the attributes of the adxl355:

.. code-block:: bash

   ls

3. Put temperature values in variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   SCALE=$(cat in_temp_scale)
   OFFSET=$(cat in_temp_offset)
   RAW=$(cat in_temp_raw)

4. Compute the temperature and display it in the terminal (keep in mind that it
   will be in millidegrees Celsius):

.. code-block:: bash

   echo "($RAW + $OFFSET) * $SCALE" | bc

Example 5: Play a Snake game with the accelerometer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the accelerometer module, you will have the chance to play a little oldie
but goldie SNAKE game.

1. Run the game controls in the background:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 /game.py &

2. Start the Snake game:

.. code-block:: bash

   /usr/games/nsnake

Move the accelerometer board around and observe the output. Be careful not to
disconnect the wires.

Have fun!

Takeaways
---------

* **Linux provides a robust embedded platform**: The combination of open-source
  licensing, lightweight resource requirements, and extensive hardware support
  makes Linux ideal for embedded systems.

* **Sysfs enables hardware interaction**: The pseudo filesystem allows
  user-space applications to interact with kernel subsystems, hardware devices,
  and device drivers through virtual files.

* **IIO simplifies sensor integration**: The Industrial I/O framework provides
  a standardized way to work with ADCs, DACs, accelerometers, and other sensors
  in embedded Linux applications.

* **Kernel modules extend functionality**: Building and loading kernel objects
  allows dynamic addition of device driver support without recompiling the
  entire kernel.

* **Scripting automates tasks**: Shell scripts enable automation of repetitive
  tasks and can be made available system-wide as commands.
