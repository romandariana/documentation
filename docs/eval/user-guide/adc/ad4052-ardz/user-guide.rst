Evaluating the device
=====================

.. note::

   This section describes how to evaluate the device using the open-source drivers,
   for the SDP-K1's closed-source platform, see
   :adi:`UG-2222 <media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad4050-ad4052-ug-2222.pdf>`.

The first step is on evaluating the device is choosing one of the following
carriers and firmware, and downloading the pre-built files:

..
   no-OS: .elf files
   linux: uImage, boot-files, devicetree (if not on Kuiper)
   artifactory links?

.. list-table::

   * - Carrier
     - no-OS
     - Linux
   * - NUCLEO-H503RB
     - download
     -
   * - NUCLEO-H563ZI
     - download
     -
   * - Cora Z7S
     -
     - download
   * - DE10-Nano
     -
     - download
   * - SDP-K1
     - download
     -

.. tip::

   For Linux, the latest Kuiper relase may contain the provided files already,
   in this case, you shall use those instead.

Hardware setup
--------------

.. note::

   These steps occurs prior to flashing the firmware for no-OS and after
   flashing it for Linux.

To set up the hardware, complete the following steps:

* Disconnect both the evaluation board and the carrier from all power sources.
* Connect the evaluation board to the carrier using the Arduino Uno compatible
  headers (there is only one position where all pins are connected).
* Check jumpers and powering on instructions specific for the carrier.
* When powering the evaluation board from the carrier, follow:

  - Set JP2 jumper on the evaluation board to the +5V position.
    This position connects the evaluation board power management circuitry to
    the +5 V pin on the Arduino Uno power header
  - Connect the carrier to a PC with a USB cable,
    the evaluation board DS1 LED should turn on, as others LEDs on the carrier.

* When powering the evaluation board from an external power supply, follow:

  - Set JP2 jumper on the evaluation board to the VIN position.
    This position connects the evaluation board power management circuitry to
    the VIN pin on the Arduino Uno power header.
  - Power on the carrier via the external power supply option (in general,
    via a DC jack),
    the evaluation board DS1 LED should turn on, as others LEDs on the carrier.
  - Connect the carrier to a PC with a USB cable.

Flashing the firmware
---------------------

no-OS
~~~~~

These steps are done after the hardware setup, with the board powered on and
connected to a PC.

Unpack the downloaded file to a folder and flash one of the example projects
(*.elf* files) to the STM32 board using the STM32 Cube IDE or copy over into the
USB driver hosted by the STM32 board.

See ``TODO :external+no-OS:doc:`projects/ad405x``` for the description of each example.

Precision-converters-firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These steps are done after the hardware setup, with the board powered on and
connected to a PC.

Unpack the downloaded file to a folder and flash the *.elf* file to the
STM32 board using the STM32 Cube IDE or copy over into the USB driver hosted
by the STM32 board.

Linux
~~~~~

These steps are done before the hardware setup, with the board powered off.

For both CoraZ7S and DE10-Nano, prepare a SD with :ref:`Kuiper <kuiper>`.

Make sure the boot files for CoraZ7S (Zynq) / DE10-Nano (Cyclone5) are present
on the SD Card.

Insert the flashed SD Card on the carrier powered off and follow the hardware
setup steps.

Quick start
-----------

Connect a precision signal source or signal generator to
the analog input Subminiature Version A (SMA) connectors to drive
the AD4050/AD4052 inputs into their specified operating ranges.

   Biasing the EVAL-AD4052-ARDZ Inputs Without Signal Generator Hardware for
   Software Validation

IIf no signal generator is available, a jumper cable between the
VREF and VCM test points can be used to bias the AD4050/
AD4052 analog inputs to VREF. This is preferred over connecting
the amplifier inputs to GND, because the amplifier VEE rails are
connected to GND by default.

Evaluation board hardware
-------------------------

Follow :adi:`UG-2222 <media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad4050-ad4052-ug-2222.pdf>`,
Evaluation Board Hardware section.


Evaluation board software
-------------------------

For no-OS basic examples, the evaluation board is interfaced through any serial
software such as minicom, picocom and putty (see ``TODO :external+no-OS:doc:`projects/ad405x```,
Basic Example section).

Using no-OS tinyIIO example, precision-converters-firmare or Linux, the interface
is done through :ref:`libiio`

For no-OS tinyIIO and precision-converters-firmware, execute on the host PC:

.. shell::

   $iio_info -u serial:/dev/ttyACM0,115200,8n1

And for Linux, on the carrier Linux shell:

.. shell::

   $iio_info

Or from the host, with a Ethernet cable connected to the carrier:

.. shell::

   $iio_info -u ip:192.168.2.1

(the IP address depends on your local network and carrier settings).

You can also use :ref:`iio-oscilloscope` on to obtain waveforms using a GUI.
