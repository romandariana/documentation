   This page provides an overview of Kuiper Linux within the ADI software 
   ecosystem. For complete build instructions, configuration options, and 
   detailed guides, see the :external+adi-kuiper-gen:doc:`the dedicated Kuiper 
   documentation </>`

Kuiper is a specialized Debian-based Linux distribution designed specifically 
for Analog Devices hardware and evaluation boards. It provides a complete, 
ready-to-use environment with ADI libraries, tools, and applications 
pre-configured for seamless hardware integration.

Rather than manually installing and configuring individual ADI software 
components, Kuiper delivers a cohesive development platform that eliminates 
setup complexity and gets you running immediately.
