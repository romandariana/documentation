SPI Engine Architecture
-----------------------

**Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) - Background**

SPI is a full-duplex serial communication bus designed by Motorola in the mid-1980s.
It is widely used for short-distance chip-to-chip communication in embedded systems
and has become a de facto industry standard despite small variations across implementations.

.. figure:: spi_master_slave.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500px

   Basic SPI interface showing master-slave connection with four signal lines.

**SPI Signal Definitions:**

:SCLK: Serial Clock from master (sets transfer rate)
:MOSI: Master Output Slave Input (data from master to slave)
:MISO: Master Input Slave Output (data from slave to master)
:CSN: Chip Select N, active low (enables specific slave device)

**SPI Operating Modes:**

SPI supports four operating modes based on two configuration bits: **CPOL** (Clock Polarity)
and **CPHA** (Clock Phase).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 12 12 61

**Why MCU SPI Controllers Are Not Sufficient for Precision Converters**

.. important::
   **Critical Limitation: MCU SPI Controllers Cannot Achieve Datasheet Performance**

   Traditional MCU SPI controllers introduce timing jitter and limit sampling rates,
   preventing precision converters from reaching their full potential.

**Physical Layer Limitations:**

- 3-wire SPI support (less common than 4-wire)
- CS often serves dual purposes (chip select AND conversion trigger)
- No support for additional control lines (BUSY, CNV)
- Single MOSI/MISO line limitation
- **SCLK frequency limited to ~50MHz** (higher speeds rare)
- Fixed timing relationships between interface signals
- No synchronization capability with external signals
- No DDR (double data rate) support

**Software-Driven Performance Issues:**

:High Latency: Software overhead prevents fast response times
:No Streaming: Cannot support continuous high-throughput data capture
:Non-Deterministic: Time between function call and actual transfer is variable
:CPU Overhead: Processor must manage every transfer, limiting system performance

.. attention::
   The combination of these limitations means MCU SPI controllers typically achieve
   only 15-20% of a converter's datasheet performance specifications!

**SPI Transfer Timing Examples**

**SPI Engine Framework – The Solution**

.. note::
   **Open-Source, Production-Ready Framework**

   SPI Engine is a highly flexible and powerful open-source SPI controller framework
   specifically designed to overcome the limitations of traditional SPI controllers.

The framework consists of multiple submodules that communicate over well-defined
interfaces, enabling high flexibility and reusability while remaining highly
customizable and easily extensible.

**Key Framework Features:**

:Multi-Vendor HDL: Supports both AMD Xilinx and Intel FPGAs
:Linux Integration: Fully integrated into the Linux kernel SPI framework
:Bare-Metal Support: Standalone API for RTOS and bare-metal applications
:Production Ready: Extensively tested with numerous ADI converters
:Open Source: Available on GitHub with active community support

**Benefits Over Traditional SPI:**

- Hardware-driven transfers with **deterministic timing**
- Support for **high-speed continuous streaming** (>100 MSPS data rates)
- **Sub-microsecond latency** for conversion triggers
- Flexible timing control to meet any converter's requirements
- Simultaneous support for multiple SPI devices

**SPI Engine Framework – HDL Architecture**

The SPI Engine uses a modular architecture with three main components communicating
via standardized AXI-Stream interfaces.

.. figure:: spie_framework.png
   :align: center
   :width: 75%

   Complete SPI Engine framework architecture showing the three main components:
   Command Stream Generator (CSG), Interconnect (CSI), and Executor (CSE).

**Component Descriptions:**

.. glossary::

   Command Stream Generator (CSG)
      Generates SPI command sequences. Can operate in multiple modes:

      - **Software driven**: Controlled through memory-mapped registers
      - **Hardware driven**: Triggered by external events for data offload
      - **Periodic**: Generates commands at fixed intervals
      - **Synchronous**: Responds to external trigger signals

   Command Stream Executor (CSE)
      Parses incoming command streams and drives the physical SPI pins.

      - Standard parser for common SPI protocols
      - Customizable for special requirements (e.g., custom SDI latching)
      - Handles all SPI modes and timing configurations

   Command Stream Interconnect (CSI)
      Arbitrates multiple command streams to a single executor.

      - Supports multiple CSGs sharing one physical SPI interface
      - Priority-based arbitration (lower port number = higher priority)
      - Transaction-level switching (uses SYNC instruction)

**SPI Engine Framework – AXI SPI Engine IP**

The AXI SPI Engine IP provides the memory-mapped interface for software control
and configuration.

**Key Features:**

- Memory-mapped access to command stream interface (fully software-controlled CSG)
- Memory-mapped access to offload control for dynamic reconfiguration
- Asynchronous clock domains (SPI clock independent of AXI clock)
- FIFO buffers for command, SDO, and SDI data
- Interrupt support for transfer completion

   :align: center
   :width: 600px

   connections to the SPI Engine execution core.

**SPI Engine Framework – Data Offload IP**

The Data Offload module enables autonomous, hardware-triggered SPI transfers
without CPU intervention, critical for high-performance streaming applications.

**Offload Capabilities:**

- Internal RAM/ROM stores command sequences and SDO data
- External trigger launches predefined command stream
- Received SDI data streams directly to AXI4-Stream interface
- Direct DMA connection for zero-copy data transfer
- Supports continuous, periodic sampling at maximum rates

.. tip::
   The offload module is essential for achieving 1+ MSPS with precision converters,
   as it eliminates all software latency and CPU overhead.

.. figure:: spie_offload_ip.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

   for autonomous high-speed operation.

**SPI Engine Framework – Interconnect IP**

The Interconnect enables multiple command sources to share a single physical
SPI interface, useful when mixing software-controlled and hardware-offloaded transfers.

**Interconnect Features:**

- Arbitrates multiple command streams to one executor
- Transaction-level arbitration (complete SPI transfers are atomic)
- SYNC instruction marks transaction boundaries
- Priority-based: Lower slave port number = higher priority
- No command stream fragmentation

.. figure:: spie_interconnect_ip.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

   single output feeding the execution module.

**SPI Engine Framework – Execution IP**

The Execution module is the physical layer that converts command streams into
actual SPI signal transitions with precise timing control.

**Execution Features:**

- Accepts commands on the AXI-Stream control interface
- Generates low-level SPI signals (SCLK, MOSI, MISO, CS)
- Active signal indicates busy status during command processing
- Configurable for all SPI modes (0-3)
- Supports variable word lengths and transfer delays
- Precise timing control for converter-specific requirements

.. figure:: spie_execution_ip.png
   :align: center
   :width: 550px

   Execution IP showing command stream input, timing control, and physical SPI
   signal outputs with precise waveform generation.

**SPI Engine Framework – Command Stream Interfaces**

The framework uses four dedicated AXI-Stream interfaces for different data types:

:CMD: Command/instruction stream
:SDO: SPI write data stream (Master Output, Slave Input / MOSI)
:SDI: SPI read data stream (Master Input, Slave Output / MISO)
:SYNC: Synchronization event stream

**Interface Characteristics:**

- Standard AXI-Stream handshaking protocol (ready, valid, data signals)
- Allows independent flow control for each stream
- Enables efficient pipelining and buffering
- Simple, well-defined interface for custom IP integration

**SPI Engine Framework – Software Support**

The framework introduces comprehensive **SPI offload** capabilities to Linux and bare-metal systems.

**Offload Concept:**

Moves converter-specific operations from the application processor to dedicated hardware,
dramatically improving performance and reducing CPU load.

**Software Features:**

:Interrupt Offload: Hardware manages conversion timing and interrupts
:Data Offload: Direct DMA transfers bypass CPU entirely
:Universal API: ADI converter drivers work with any offload-capable SPI controller
:Linux Integration: Part of standard kernel SPI framework (drivers/spi/spi-axi-spi-engine.c)
:Bare-Metal Support: Standalone API for embedded applications

.. note::
   Once an ADI converter driver is written for SPI Engine, it can be used with
   any other offload-capable SPI controller with minimal changes.

Conclusions
-----------

.. admonition:: Workshop Summary
   :class: summary

   Through this hands-on workshop, we demonstrated the dramatic performance
   improvement achievable with FPGA-based SPI Engine compared to traditional
   MCU SPI controllers.

**Key Findings:**

#. **MCU SPI Limitations**: Traditional MCU controllers are suitable only for
   converters with sampling rates up to ~100 KSPS and can achieve only 15-20%
   of a converter's datasheet performance.

#. **FPGA Requirement for Maximum Performance**: Achieving full datasheet
   specifications (sampling rate, SNR, THD) requires FPGA-based timing control
   with deterministic, low-jitter operation.

#. **SPI Engine Framework**: This highly flexible, open-source SPI controller
   framework successfully interfaces with a wide range of precision converters,
   providing:

   - Hardware-driven, deterministic timing
   - Support for 1+ MSPS continuous streaming
   - Near-datasheet AC performance (>79% SNR achievement)
   - Minimal CPU overhead (<1%)

#. **Production-Ready Solution Stack**: The complete COS (Customer Obsession through
   Software) open-source ecosystem provides HDL, Linux drivers, and tools for rapid
   development and deployment.

**Performance Achieved:**

- **1.33 MSPS** continuous sampling (vs. 15 KSPS with MCU SPI)
- **77.7 dB SNR** at full rate (vs. 14.8 dB with MCU SPI)
- **-110 dB THD** matching datasheet (vs. -45.6 dB with MCU SPI)
